NAME
    autobox::Camelize - autobox methods for (de)camelcasing

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of autobox::Camelize - released
    March 17, 2013 as part of autobox-Camelize.

SYNOPSIS
        use autobox::Camelize;

        # $foo is 'this_is__my__name'
        my $foo = 'ThisIs::My::Name'->decamelize;

        # $bar is 'ThisIs::NotMy::Name'
        my $bar = 'this_is__not_my__name'->camelize;

DESCRIPTION
    This is a simple set of autobox methods that work on strings, and
    camelize/decamelize them according to how the author thinks camelization
    should work:

    Camelizing replaces '__[a-z]' with '::[A-Z]', and '_[a-z]' with '[A-Z]'.
    The first character is capitalized.

    Decamelizing replaces '::[A-Z]' with '__[a-z]', and '[A-Z]' with
    '_[a-z]'. The first character is lowercased.

STRING METHODS
  camelize
    Camelize a string.

  decamelize
    Decamelize a string.
